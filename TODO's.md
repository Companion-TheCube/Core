- [src/gui/renderables/meshLoader.cpp:485] : rework this method so that we only parse for the values we need for each type of keyframe
- [src/gui/renderables/shapes.cpp:251] : Implement rotation of text
- [src/gui/renderables/shapes.cpp:34] : the font is being loaded for each instance of an M_Text object and should be made static so that it only gets loaded once and is shared between all instances of M_Text
- [src/gui/renderables/shapes.h:559] : create a generic object class that can utilize vertex and face data loaded from a file
- [src/gui/renderer.cpp:129] : this call should return a nullptr if the character is not found. Then we should throw an error.
- [src/gui/renderer.cpp:153] : replace this with a CountingLatch. This will be cleaner.
- [src/gui/renderer.cpp:34] : migrate from SFML to GLFW since we aren't using any SFML specific features
- [src/gui/renderer.cpp:95] : maybe one day, support a second window that renders on the second screen.
- [src/gui/renderer.cpp:98] : figure out how to pause rendering and close the window when the emulator starts up.
- [src/gui/statusBar.cpp:36] : Implement StatusBar
- [src/gui/statusBar.h:37] :
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:1026] : add all the services that we want to use
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:1033] : this->client_id needs a mutex. When this class is destroyed, we need to make sure we can get a lock on that mutex
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:1078] : The server will need to listen for any incoming requests from the BTManager application and handle them.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:1143] : This should shutdown the BTManager class enough to allow adding new BT Services.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:1157] : This should start the BTManager class after it has been stopped.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:1171] : This should provide a way to add a new BT Service to the BTManager.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:119] : Setup all the callback endpoints
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:43] : since the BT_Manager app is far from complete, we should just mock the bluetooth functions for now.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:521] : need to prompt the user to accept the pairing request. This will require a call to the appropriate GUI function.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:536] : notify the user
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:550] : notify the user
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:556] : update the Global setting for bluetooth enabled
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:562] : update the Global setting for bluetooth enabled
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:566] :
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:572] : register the callbacks with the GlobalSettings class so that the enabled/disable/etc actions get called when the setting is changed.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:65] : In order to comply with Qt licensing, we will have to have all the code that interfaces
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:92] : create a default config for basic functionality in the event the file is not found
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:952] : we need to add this characteristic to config json for this service
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:980] : this section depends on the BTManager application being completed. We will need to update this section
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:984] : Start the BTManager. The command line args for this should include the address for an http endpoint
- [src/hardware/io_bridge/spi.cpp:139] :
- [src/hardware/io_bridge/spi.cpp:211] : Placeholder: return txBytes as rxBytes for now
- [src/hardware/io_bridge/spi.cpp:341] : Implement the other endpoints
- [src/hardware/mmWave.cpp:353] : Check this
- [src/hardware/mmWave.h:49] : add some ifdefs and defines for the port name on RasPi
- [src/hardware/mmWave.h:50] : add ifdefs for Windows so that this will compile on Windows
- [src/hardware/peripheralManager.cpp:36] : Implement the peripheral manager. This class will be responsible for managing all the hardware and providing the API endpoints.
- [src/hardware/pi_i2c.cpp:3] : The I2C Class methods that take care of writing and reading to the I2C bus need to be rewritten so that
- [src/hardware/pi_i2c.h:21] : Break the I2C class out into header and implementation files like SPI class.
- [src/hardware/pi_i2c.h:23] : This needs a bit of a rewrite so that it is more easily used by NFC, FANCTRL, and other I2C related classes.
- [src/hardware/wifi.cpp:225] : many of the functions below use the same boilerplate code, consider refactoring.
- [src/hardware/wifi.cpp:34] : all of te nmcli commands can use the -t flag to get a terse version of the output. This is easier to parse and has fewer spaces. This should make it faster(?).
- [src/hardware/wifi.cpp:35] : refactor all the nmcli commands so that the function that use it can have a more reusable version.
- [src/hardware/wifi.cpp:61] : finish implementing the WifiManager class
- [src/logger/logger.cpp:496] : this may not be needed since the log is just going to grow again
- [src/logger/logger.cpp:783] : add endpoint(s) to get logs. perhaps have the ability to get logs by level, by date, etc. and/or logs from memory or from file
- [src/logger/logger.cpp:830] : source string should be prepended with the name of the source app or it's IP or something. That way, we know
- [src/main.cpp:260] : All the base apps should be inserted into the database and/or verified in the database here.
- [src/main.cpp:303] : add the insert for the openwakeword python script here. This will be a native app and will use the python executable in the openwakeword/venv/bin(Linux) or openwakeword/Scripts(Windows) directory.
- [src/main.cpp:347] : any other place where main() might return, change the return value to something meaningful. this way, when
- [src/main.cpp:352] : this probably needs a mutex for breakMain
- [src/main.cpp:81] : rather than set this environment variable in this application, set it in the manager application. The manager app
- [src/telemetry/telemetry.cpp:34] : Implement telemetry.cpp
- [src/telemetry/telemetry.cpp:38] : Implement telemetry.cpp
- [src/utils.cpp:76] : fix this
