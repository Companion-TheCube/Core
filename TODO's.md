# TODO's
- Any file that has user-facing strings should have Gettext support using #define _(string) gettext(string). We also need to add the necessary code to the CMakeLists.txt file to generate the .pot file and the .mo files. Probably should keep track of which files have strings that need to be translated.
- Need to make a github for the translations so that people can contribute translations.
- Add API endpoints to Logger for logging from outside apps - Done?
- Apps that provide characters (for the UI) will have to provide a blob of the character data that we can deserialize into the character object. 
- Add status bar to the GUI
- Make the popup messageBox more like a dialog box 
- Write tests
- Migrate from SFML to GLFW
- Window manager interface: Use XCB and xcb-ewmh to interface with the matchbox window manager so that we can control which window is on top and which window has focus. This will be particularly useful for games or apps with guis, like if a game runs in chromium or an app needs to have the user interact with a web page. Really, any app that needs a GUI outside of the main Core GUI will need this.
- If remote AI services is enabled, we need to check on a regular that it is available. If it is not, there needs to be an indicator, maybe a little red dot in the corner of the screen, that the service is not available. If the service becomes available, the indicator should disappear. This indicator may be well suited to be in the status bar if we ever get around to adding that.
- Sentences used for natural language matching need to be translated. Use the same methods as for the UI strings.
- There needs to be docker containers for postgres and redis that apps can use to store data that does not need to be accessible by TheCube-Core. CORE will start the container, manage database creation, and provide the connection string to the apps. The apps will be responsible for creating the tables and managing the data. This will allow apps to have their own databases without having to worry about the underlying database engine.

- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:1066] : add all the services that we want to use
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:1073] : this->client_id needs a mutex. When this class is destroyed, we need to make sure we can get a lock on that mutex
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:1118] : The server will need to listen for any incoming requests from the BTManager application and handle them.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:1185] : This should shutdown the BTManager class enough to allow adding new BT Services.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:1198] : This should start the BTManager class after it has been stopped.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:1211] : This should provide a way to add a new BT Service to the BTManager.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:125] : Setup all the callback endpoints
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:43] : since the BT_Manager app is far from complete, we should just mock the bluetooth functions for now.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:527] : need to prompt the user to accept the pairing request. This will require a call to the appropriate GUI function.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:542] : notify the user
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:556] : notify the user
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:562] : update the Global setting for bluetooth enabled
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:568] : update the Global setting for bluetooth enabled
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:572] :
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:578] : register the callbacks with the GlobalSettings class so that the enabled/disable/etc actions get called when the setting is changed.
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:65] : In order to comply with Qt licensing, we will have to have all the code that interfaces
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:83] : Need to check if the port is available
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:962] : we need to add this characteristic to config json for this service
- [src/hardware/bluetooth.cpp:98] : create a default config for basic functionality in the event the file is not found
- [src/hardware/mmWave.cpp:353] : Check this
- [src/hardware/mmWave.h:49] : add some ifdefs and defines for the port name on RasPi
- [src/hardware/mmWave.h:50] : add ifdefs for Windows so that this will compile on Windows
- [src/hardware/peripheralManager.cpp:36] : Implement the peripheral manager. This class will be responsible for managing all the hardware and providing the API endpoints.
- [src/hardware/wifi.cpp:225] : many of the functions below use the same boilerplate code, consider refactoring.
- [src/hardware/wifi.cpp:34] : all of te nmcli commands can use the -t flag to get a terse version of the output. This is easier to parse and has fewer spaces. This should make it faster(?).
- [src/hardware/wifi.cpp:35] : refactor all the nmcli commands so that the function that use it can have a more reusable version.
- [src/hardware/wifi.cpp:61] : finish implementing the WifiManager class
- [src/logger/logger.cpp:496] : this may not be needed since the log is just going to grow again
- [src/logger/logger.cpp:783] : add endpoint(s) to get logs. perhaps have the ability to get logs by level, by date, etc. and/or logs from memory or from file
- [src/logger/logger.cpp:828] : source string should be prepended with the name of the source app or it's IP or something. That way, we know
- [src/main.cpp:277] : All the base apps should be inserted into the database and/or verified in the database here.
- [src/main.cpp:332] : add the insert for the openwakeword python script here. This will be a native app and will use the python executable in the openwakeword/venv/bin(Linux) or openwakeword/Scripts(Windows) directory.
- [src/main.cpp:374] : any other place where main() might return, change the return value to something meaningful. this way, when
- [src/main.cpp:379] : this probably needs a mutex for breakMain
- [src/main.cpp:76] : rather than set this environment variable in this application, set it in the manager application. The manager app
- [src/telemetry/telemetry.cpp:34] : Implement telemetry.cpp
- [src/telemetry/telemetry.cpp:38] : Implement telemetry.cpp
- [src/utils.cpp:163] : fix this
