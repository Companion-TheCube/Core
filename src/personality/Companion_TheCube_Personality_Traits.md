## Adjusting Personality Traits

TheCube’s personality traits can be adjusted dynamically based on various factors:

- **User Engagement Patterns**: If the user responds positively to playful interactions, increase the character's playfulness over time. If reminders are often dismissed, reduce empathy and cautionary traits.
  
- **Time of Day**: During peak working hours, TheCube could lean more toward attentiveness and productivity-focused encouragement. In the evening, it might shift to emphasize relaxation reminders.

- **User Health and Productivity Data**: If TheCube detects prolonged sitting or missed breaks, it can increase cautionary and empathetic traits, showing concern and suggesting wellness tips.

- **User Commands or Feedback**: Allow the user to “teach” the character over time by adjusting traits directly in settings or based on feedback (e.g., if the user finds the character too playful, they can adjust it to be more serious).

These traits and adjustment strategies help make TheCube a dynamic, adaptable companion, responding to the user's work habits and well-being needs.
